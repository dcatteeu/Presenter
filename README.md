# Presenter #

Presenter mimics Keynote's presentation mode for PDFs.

Keynote's presentation mode lets you display your slides in fullscreen on the second screen (such as a beamer projecting on the wall) while, on the main screen (your laptop), you can display the current slide, the next one, your notes, a timer, etc. Keynote's presentation mode is very useful but works only with Keynote presentation, not with PDFs.
